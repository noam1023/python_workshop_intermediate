topic: Add unit test to a piece of code and run it

Requirements:
* Choose a class you already created and add unit test to it
* Run the test, make sure it FAILS (if needed, cripple the tested class)
* Fix the tested class, run again, make sure it PASSES
* Add 3 more tests (each in its own function)
* Bonus points: use Fixture (https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/python-testing-pytest-fixtures-and-coverage)
* Even more gartifying bonus: check the code coverage (see above link)
