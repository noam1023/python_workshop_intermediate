topic: experiment with profiling your source code

Profiling is finding WHERE your code spends most of the time

Requirements
* use source code you already used; something that takes more than seconds to complete.
  e.g. ex4, limit it to single use case so the normal run time is less than a minute.
* run with profiler
* analize the profiler output . Try to find the 'hot spot' 
* think how to reduce the runtime , and by how much do you expect to improve (e.g. "hope to reduce by 40%")
